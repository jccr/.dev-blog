# It's about time I launch this!

After about a year of holding, and paying, for this domain (and other potential domains that are way older)...
I've finally decided to do it. I'll launch a personal website!

My original plan was to make a witty, cheeky, out of this world, built-from-scratch portfolio site. 
I'm not much of a writer so I thought that'd be the best!
Well.. after procrastinating on that original idea, and as my need for an outlet for my thoughts grew out...
I decided to throw away the idea of building this from scratch and just use what ever is most convinient.

I'm a software developer who writes documentation, so I picked what's natural to me:

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which provides [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which lets me post using [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
